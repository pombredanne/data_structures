# Counting Sketches
A collection of useful data streaming sketches for counting items in a data
stream.

**CountMinSketch**: 
Depends on xxhash version 0.4.3 and above. xxhash was chosen for its fast
performance as it is a non-cryptographic hash function.

(2005), 29–38.

**ApproximateCounting**: 
Classic Morris counter sketch that was analyzed in detail by Phillipe 
Flajolet. Used to count large frequencies of items in small registers. 
Precursor to modern sketches.
