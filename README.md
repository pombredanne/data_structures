# Data Structures and Algorithms
A collection of data structures and algorithms.

1. *fenwick_tree.py*: implementation of a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree. Used for fast querying of cumulative counts of a set of numbers.
2. *ipf.py*: implementation of Iterative Proportional Fitting, a scaling procedure on non-negative matrices (e.g. contingency tables) to ensure the marginals are met to specified row and column sum constraints.
3. *counting_sketches*: library of several well-known sketches for counting items on data streams, including the Count Min Sketch and the Morris counter.
4. *shortest_paths.py*: implements the computation of all shortest paths on a graph via the Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra algorithm.
5. *priority_queue.py*: priority queue implementation via heaps.
