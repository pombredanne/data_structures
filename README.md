# Data Structures and Algorithms
A collection of data structures and algorithms.

1. fenwick_tree.py: Implmentation of a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree. Used for fast querying of cumulative counts of a set of numbers.
2. ipf.py: Implmentation of Iterative Proportional Fitting, a scaling procedure on non-negative matrices (e.g. contingency tables) to ensure the marginals are met to specified row and column sum constraints.
