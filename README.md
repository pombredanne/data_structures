# Data Structures and Algorithms
A collection of data structures and algorithms.

1. fenwick_tree.py: Implementation of a Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree. Used for fast querying of cumulative counts of a set of numbers.
2. ipf.py: Implementation of Iterative Proportional Fitting, a scaling procedure on non-negative matrices (e.g. contingency tables) to ensure the marginals are met to specified row and column sum constraints.
3. counting_sketches: library of several well-known sketches for counting items on data streams, including the Count Min Sketch and the Morris counter.
4. shortest_paths: implements the computation of all shortest paths on a graph via the Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra algorithm.
